    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Wikipedia#References">Wikipedia, a free-content online encyclopedia written and maintained by a community of volunteers known as Wikipedians,
    began with its first edit on 15 January 2001, two days after the domain was registered.[2] It grew out of Nupedia, a
    more structured free encyclopedia, as a way to allow easier and faster drafting of articles and translations.</blockquote>
