   <h5><i>History of My School:</i> 
   <br><br>After the British government in India replaced Persian with English as the official language, Indian Muslims abandoned
    English. Consequently, Indian Muslims soon faced ruin due to a lack of education. Sir Syed Ahmad Khan took steps to
    protect Indian Muslims from destruction. After much struggle, he encouraged them to learn English and established the
    Aligarh University. This history is well-known.<br><br>
    
    The Muslims of Brahmanbaria also faced the risk of ruin due to lack of education. Following Sir Syed Ahmad Khan's
    example, several prominent Muslim figures and social workers in Brahmanbaria city came forward to establish an English
    school in the city. They were: the late Munshi Abdul Kadir, the late Abbas Khan, the late Syed Mohammad Ali, the late
    Khan Bahadur Abdur Rauf, and the late Khan Sahib Ansar Ali Muktar.<br><br>
    
    On March 3, 1910, they established George Minor School (George M. E. School) on a vacant plot of land on the eastern
    side of Brahmanbaria Sadar Thana. It is noteworthy that during British rule, a high school could not be established
    directly. Initially, it was a minor school and later upgraded to a high school. Due to a significant increase in
    students, the school was relocated to the Modail region (its current location). In 1914, it was upgraded to George High
    English School and in 1919, it received permanent recognition from the University of Calcutta. Soon, the school became
    filled with both Hindu and Muslim students due to its high-quality teaching staff.

<q>Education is not the learning of facts, but the training of the mind to think.</q></small></h5>
<h6><mark>About School</mark><br><p><blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"> school is both the educational institution and building designed to provide learning spaces and learning environments
for the teaching of students under the direction of teachers. Most countries have systems of formal education, which is
sometimes compulsory.[2] In these systems, students progress through a series of schools that can be built and operated
by both government and private organization. The names for these schools vary by country (discussed in the Regional
terms section below) but generally include primary school for young children and secondary school for teenagers who have
completed primary education. An institution where higher education is taught is commonly called a university college or
university.</blockquote></p></h6>
