           <dd>In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, education is a window through which distant objects can be
        viewed closely. There is no alternative to education for the development of a person's personality. The necessity of
        educational institutions is essential for the orderly quest for knowledge. From this realization, a few individuals in
        the heart of Brahmanbaria city felt the need for an ideal educational institution. With their efforts, this institution
        began its journey in 1910. Over the course of time, the institution has traversed more than a century. Since its
        inception, the school has been committed to spreading the light of education, fostering creative talents, and shaping
        skilled generations.
        
        Currently, we are tirelessly working with a group of talented, highly educated, skilled, and trained teachers to build
        responsible citizens, while keeping up with information and communication technology. In order to establish our position
        in this competitive world while facing the challenges of the 21st century, the development of information technology is
        indispensable. In recognition of this necessity, various activities have already been undertaken to ensure the use of
        technology at Niyaz Muhammad High School. Notable among these are classes using audio devices, multimedia classrooms,
        and class activities conducted with digital content created by teachers.
        
        We express our heartfelt gratitude and congratulations to all the dedicated individuals, teachers, and well-wishers who
        have lovingly brought the school to this point since its establishment in 1910. We also respectfully remember and
        congratulate all former students of this school, especially those who have made and continue to make significant
        contributions to building a beautiful, fair, and transparent world.
        
        I seek the cooperation of everyone for the overall development of this institution. I am hopeful that this school will
        become one of the leading institutions in the country, aimed at building a technology-driven and scientifically-minded
        nation.

        <i>History of My School:</i>
        <br><br>After the British government in India replaced Persian with English as the official language, Indian Muslims
        abandoned
        English. Consequently, Indian Muslims soon faced ruin due to a lack of education. Sir Syed Ahmad Khan took steps to
        protect Indian Muslims from destruction. After much struggle, he encouraged them to learn English and established
        the
        Aligarh University. This history is well-known.<br><br>
    
        The Muslims of Brahmanbaria also faced the risk of ruin due to lack of education. Following Sir Syed Ahmad Khan's
        example, several prominent Muslim figures and social workers in Brahmanbaria city came forward to establish an
        English
        school in the city. They were: the late Munshi Abdul Kadir, the late Abbas Khan, the late Syed Mohammad Ali, the
        late
        Khan Bahadur Abdur Rauf, and the late Khan Sahib Ansar Ali Muktar.<br><br>
    
        On March 3, 1910, they established George Minor School (George M. E. School) on a vacant plot of land on the eastern
        side of Brahmanbaria Sadar Thana. It is noteworthy that during British rule, a high school could not be established
        directly. Initially, it was a minor school and later upgraded to a high school. Due to a significant increase in
        students, the school was relocated to the Modail region (its current location). In 1914, it was upgraded to George
        High
        English School and in 1919, it received permanent recognition from the University of Calcutta. Soon, the school
        became
        filled with both Hindu and Muslim students due to its high-quality teaching staff.

        <p>
        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"> school is both the educational institution and building
            designed to provide learning spaces and learning environments
            for the teaching of students under the direction of teachers. Most countries have systems of formal education,
            which is
            sometimes compulsory.[2] In these systems, students progress through a series of schools that can be built and
            operated
            by both government and private organization. The names for these schools vary by country (discussed in the
            Regional
            terms section below) but generally include primary school for young children and secondary school for teenagers
            who have
            completed primary education. An institution where higher education is taught is commonly called a university
            college or
            university.</blockquote>
